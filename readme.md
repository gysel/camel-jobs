`camel-jobs` was developed as part of a semester thesis at [HSR](http://www.hsr.ch) by [Michael Gysel](https://github.com/gysel) and [Lukas Koelbener](https://github.com/koelbener). It aims to enhance Apache Camel with additional components so that it can be used as an integration job engine.

`camel-jobs` does currently not provide stable releases. Hopefully this will change in the near future.  

## Maven Projects

* `camel-nomin` integrates [Nomin](https://github.com/dobrynya/nomin) into Apache Camel.
* `camel-jobs` enhances Apache Camel with a job engine. Error handling, monitoring and triggers (JMX, REST, JMS) are automatically added to all routes whose id starts with `job-`.
* `camel-jobs-samples` showcases the job engine using some sample jobs.
